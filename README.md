Paper abstract:  
*The 3GPP specified for the first time in Release 14 the support for V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications. This LTE evolution is known as C-V2X, Cellular V2X, or LTE-V, and enables the direct V2V communications through the so-called PC5 interface or sidelink. For the management of the radio resources of the PC5 interface, the 3GPP standards define two operation modes: Mode 3 (centralized) and Mode 4 (distributed). This paper focuses on Mode 3, which exploits the knowledge of the cellular infrastructure to minimize the negative effect of the interferences and improve the V2X communications performance. However, the 3GPP standards do not define any concrete scheduling solution for Mode 3. Recent studies have proposed centralized scheduling schemes for Mode 3, mostly based on the geographical position of vehicles, but most of them make use of static parameters and assumptions that limit their scalability and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel centralized C-V2X Mode 3 scheduling scheme that is designed to homogeneously distribute the interfering vehicles. The performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated by simulations and validated against an analytical performance model proposed in this paper. The results obtained demonstrate that it can provide higher performance than existing scheduling schemes, including C-V2X Mode 4. The evaluations conducted in this paper also demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed scheduling scheme.*

This model quantifies the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) that could be achieved with our proposed scheme as a function of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. In order to model the PDR, the following four mutually exclusive errors present in C-V2X are quantified:  
  1)	Errors due to half-duplex transmissions (HD)  
  2)	Errors due to a received signal power below the sensing power threshold (SEN)  
  3)	Errors due to propagation effects (PRO)  
  4)	Errors due to packet collisions (COL)  
  
CV2XMode3.m is the main script you have to run to get the PDR curve as a function of the distance for a given set of parameters, and the probability of each of the four transmission errors.

Input parameters (shall be set manually in the beginning of the code):  
* alpha: traffic density in veh/km. Values tested: 120.  
* lambda: pNumber of packets transmitted per second per vehicle. Values tested: 10, 20 and 50.  
* Psen: sensing threshold (dBm). Values tested: -90.5  
* Pt: transmission power in dBm. Values tested: 23.  
* S: number of sub-channels per sub-frame. Values tested: 2 and 4.  
* B: packet size in bytes. Values tested: 190.  

Output metrics:
* PDR: Packet Delivery Ratio for different Tx-Rx distances    
* deltaHD: probability of packet loss due to half-duplex transmissions for different Tx-Rx distances  
* deltaSEN: probability of packet loss due to a received signal power below the sensing power threshold for different Tx-Rx distances  
* deltaPRO: probability of packet loss due to propagation effects for different Tx-Rx distances  
* deltaCOL: probability of packet loss due to packet collisions for different Tx-Rx distances
